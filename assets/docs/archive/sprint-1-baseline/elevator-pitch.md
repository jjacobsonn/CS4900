## Project Elevator Pitch — Vellum

**Vellum** is a fast, mobile-first digital asset review and approval platform designed for teams that prioritize speed and clarity over bloated tooling.
It treats approval as structured system data rather than informal comments, enabling clear approval states, auditable decisions, and predictable workflows.
Vellum provides lightweight, role-aware creative reviews optimized for real-world usage, especially on mobile devices, without the complexity or cost of traditional enterprise solutions.
