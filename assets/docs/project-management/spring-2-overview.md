**Project:** Vellum - Digital Asset Review & Approval Platform  
**Term:** Spring 2026 — Spring-2 Phase

---

## Purpose

This document captures the goals, deliverables, and required documentation updates for the Spring-2 phase of the project. It maps Sprint 1 outputs into actionable work for subsequent sprints and prescribes the documentation and meeting cadence required for team reviews.

## Goals for Spring-2

- Complete core backend API endpoints (assets, comments, status updates)
- Implement authentication and role-based access control
- Implement frontend pages for asset list, detail, upload, and admin
- Add file upload capability and storage configuration
- Increase unit and integration test coverage (backend + frontend)
- Prepare final demo and deployment instructions

## Documentation Requirements (must be kept up-to-date)

Each team member must maintain:

- Personal Journal: `assets/docs/personal/<your>-journal-<initials>.md` — weekly updates
- Project Follow-up: `assets/docs/project-management/project-follow-up.md` — update before each 4-week review
- Schedule: `assets/docs/project-management/schedule.md` — mark tasks completed
- Sprint Review Summary: `assets/docs/project-management/sprint-<n>-review-summary.md` — completed at sprint end

## Sprint Mapping (high-level)

- Sprint 2 (Feb 24 - Mar 9): Core API endpoints, authentication design, unit tests
- Sprint 3 (Mar 10 - Mar 23): Frontend implementation & integration
- Sprint 4 (Mar 24 - Apr 6): Testing, performance tuning, diagnostics
- Sprint 5 (Apr 7 - Apr 20): Advanced features, bug fixing
- Sprint 6 (Apr 21 - May 4): Final polish, deployment, final exam demo

## Review & Meeting Cadence

- Team reviews occur every four weeks on the 3rd Wednesday.
- Each review should include:
  - Updated Project Follow-up document (this repository)
  - Personal journals for every team member
  - A short demo (live or recorded) of the main feature work
  - Code review notes and an action-items list
