# Sprint 2 — Revised specs (architecture revisions)

**Purpose:** Revised architecture, versioning, admin, and UX changes. Sprint 1 docs in `sprint-1/` remain the baseline and are not renamed.

**Planned content (add as we go):**
- Versioning spec (snapshots, Git-like actions, metadata)
- API and schema changes for versioning and admin
- Admin user list and (later) company/tenant flow

**See also:** [Re-Implementation Plan](../project-management/reimplementation-plan.md) | [Architecture revision ideas](../architecture-revise.md) | [Doc versioning](../DOC-VERSIONING.md)
