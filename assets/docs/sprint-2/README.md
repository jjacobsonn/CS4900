# Sprint 2 — Four-Week Review Compliance & Revised Specs

**Primary purpose:** Satisfy the course’s **four-week project review** process. You will follow up with the project review team every four weeks (3rd Wednesday of each month and on the final exam date). Each individual must keep **Personal Journal**, **Schedule**, and **Project Follow-up** up to date; before each meeting, update the Project Follow-up with current date, schedule status, completed items, and red flags; during the meeting, capture code review notes, action items, and suggestions.

**Master checklist:** For every sprint review (and the final), the team must complete setup from the README, show service→DB and GUI→service code, have unit tests (classes, business logic, mock DB for API, mock API for GUI), demo new features and bug fixes, and compare actual vs planned status.  
→ **[SPRINT-2-PURPOSE-AND-REVIEW-REQUIREMENTS.md](SPRINT-2-PURPOSE-AND-REVIEW-REQUIREMENTS.md)** — use this to ensure **everything is being done**.

**Also in Sprint 2 (technical):** Revised architecture, versioning, admin, and UX. Sprint 1 docs in `sprint-1/` remain the baseline.

**Planned content (add as we go):**
- Versioning spec (snapshots, Git-like actions, metadata)
- API and schema changes for versioning and admin
- Admin user list and (later) company/tenant flow
