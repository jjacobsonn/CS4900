## Figma Wireframe / Mockup Request — Vellum (CS4900)

Hi Landon,

For Sprint 0 of the CS4900 project, we need to produce a **low-fidelity, non-interactive, mobile-first UI mockup** for our application, **Vellum**. This is a design-only deliverable (no implementation required) and is meant to communicate layout, flow, and intent rather than visual polish.

### Purpose

The goal of this mockup is to demonstrate:

* A mobile-first layout
* How users move through the core workflow
* Clear separation of screens and responsibilities

This will be reviewed by the class and instructor as part of Sprint-0 design artifacts.

---

## Scope of the Mockup

Please create **simple, low-fidelity wireframes** (boxes, labels, placeholders are perfect).
No colors, branding, or interactions are required.

### Required Screens (Minimum)

1. **Login Screen**

   * Email input
   * Password input
   * Login button

2. **File List Screen (Mobile)**

   * List of uploaded files
   * Each item shows:

     * File name
     * Approval status (Pending / Changes Requested / Approved)
   * Tap/click navigates to file detail view

3. **File Detail / Review Screen (Mobile)**

   * File metadata (name, version number, status)
   * Preview area (or placeholder box)
   * Comment list
   * Comment input field
   * Approval actions:

     * Approve
     * Request Changes

Optional (nice to have, not required):

* Admin overview screen
* Upload file screen

---

## Design Guidelines

* **Mobile-first** (phone-sized frames)
* **Non-interactive**
* **Low-fidelity**
* Focus on **layout and hierarchy**, not styling
* Keep it simple and readable

This is intentionally lightweight — we’re prioritizing clarity over visual polish.

---

## Deliverables

Please do **one** of the following:

### Option A — Figma (Preferred)

* Create a Figma file
* Share a **view-only link**
* Ensure the link is accessible without edit permissions

### Option B — Static Wireframes

* Export wireframes as images or PDF
* Provide them in a shared location (or send directly)

---

## Integration into Project Docs

Once complete:

* Share the Figma link or files with me
* I will reference or embed the link in the `/documentation` folder of the CS4900 GitHub repository
* The mockup will be listed as the official Sprint-0 UI artifact

---

## Timeline

Ideally completed **before the Sprint-0 review (1/21/26)** so we can walk through it during class.

Thanks for your help on this — this mockup is the final missing design artifact for Sprint 0, and your contribution will be directly referenced in the project review.

Let me know if you have any questions or want clarification on scope.

Best,
Jackson Jacobson
