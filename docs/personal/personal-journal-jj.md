## Sprint 1 - Week 1 (February 10-16, 2026)

### February 16, 2026

**Tasks Completed:**
- Pulled latest changes from main branch
- Created development branch `dev-jj`
- Reviewed project documentation and requirements
- Started preparing Sprint 1 Review materials:
  - Created Project Follow-up document
  - Created Personal Journal template
  - Began database setup script creation

**Challenges:**
- Need to ensure database setup script follows professor's requirements for normalization
- Must include default/initial records for lookup tables (roles, approval statuses)
- Need to coordinate with team on implementation priorities

**Next Steps:**
- Complete database setup SQL script
- Update README with detailed setup instructions
- Begin backend server implementation
- Set up unit testing framework

**Reflections:**
The project documentation is comprehensive, but we need to transition from planning to implementation. The Sprint 1 Review requirements are clear - we need to demonstrate a working database setup and basic project structure. I'm focusing on getting the foundational pieces in place so we can build on them in subsequent sprints.
